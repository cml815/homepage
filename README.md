Leopold Writing home page
--------------------

The repository is a beginner's stab at building a website from HTML5 and CSS3 and Jekyll. 
While this repository isn't elegant, it proves that anyone can code a website. With the proper
motivation and assistance. And a truckload of time. 

For me, this has been the most exciting project and supremely gratifying.

Structure
------------

The site is structured with an index(home) page and 4 other pages:

+ index.html 
+ work.html 
+ about.html
+ blog.html
+ contact.html
 
One primary layout with nested templates for blog and portfolio:

Primary (all pages built from here, which contain header, nav, and footer)

**default.html**

Portfolio page path: 

potfolio_entry.md --> portfolio.html --> work.html --> default.html

Blog path: 

post.md --> blog_entry.html -->  blog.html --> default.html

Building this site to a boatload of online and real-life help. 

Credits section:

**Sean Collins** [sc68cal](https://github.com/sc68cal) for Jekyll coding, Wordpress migration, tips, and much more.

Tom Preston-Warner [mojombo](https://github.com/mojombo), who among others built [Jekyll.rb](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)

[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) - Borrowed heavily from their ideas, namely 12-column and fixed top navbar.

[HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) - Studied their code and my concept of a reset.css came largely from them.

[Nordkapp](http://www.nordkapp.fi) - Fell in love with this Finnish design co site. They deserve credit for the ideas I used from them.

Help with CSS was abundant online. I leaned heavily on [CSS-tricks](CSS-tricks.com). 
Used free background images from [Subtle Patterns](subtlepatterns.com).
