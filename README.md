Leopold Writing home page

The repository is a beginner's stab at building a website from HTML5 and CSS3 and Jekyll.

The site is structured:

-root
  index.html 
  work.html 
  about.html
  blog.html
  contact.html
  favicon.ico
  _layouts
    default.html (layout for all pages)
    portfolio.html (layout to build pieces into portfolio)
    portfolio_entry (layout of raw portfolio entry)
    blog_entry (layout to assemble blog post)    
    post.html (raw blog posts in markdown filtered into layout)
  -img

Acknowledgements

Building this site to a boatload of online and real-life help. 
I plan to make a credits section. 
My partner, who is a programmer introduced me to this world. He was the one, who bailed me
out of countless scrapes with code. I learned not to tinker with paths and don't mess with Liquid.
