				<h1>About Caroline Leopold, MA, GPC</h1>
				<h2>What I do.</h2>
				<p>Write and edit products worthy of funding or publication.</p> 
				<h2>How it works.</h2>
				<p>Consult and then partner with you. You supply vision, expertise, and direction. And, I integrate expert input, data, and technical requirements into a cogent product. Revisions always come with the job.</p>
				<h2>Experience.</p>
					<p>Since 1999, I have won $10 million from proposals. My success is from expertise and understanding submission strategy. I only write grants where the return is worth the effort.</p>

					<p>I am adept at seeing the big picture, while attending to minute details. Publications may fail on formatting alone. Grants are also strict. That is why systems (and backups) are critical.</p>

					<p>In addition to working for write-for-hire projects, I also have bylines. I have authored news articles and editorials that have been published on websites.</p>
