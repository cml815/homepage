				<h1>About Caroline Leopold, MA, GPC</h1>
				<h2>First, what I do.</h2>
				<p><span>Purpose:</span> produce a written product worthy of funding or publication.</p> 
				<h2>How it works.</h2>
				<p>Exceptional writing requires a concentration of expertise from my clients and myself. The clients supply vision, expertise and direction. And I pull research, data, and RFP requirements into a cogent document.</p>
				<p>A typical project has a short timeline, but has great importance. Government grants and procurements never have enough time.</p>
				<h2>Experience</p>
					<p>My grants career took of in 1999 after writing a successful federal grant for a well-known Chicago theater, Second City. Since then, I have secured more than $10 million in grants and contracts. My background in program development, data analysis, and program evaluation was what made me successful. I designed programs and wrote grants. Also, I was able to analyze data and find stories of excellence or of promise.</p>

					<p>As a lifelong learner, I am constantly updating my skills. I am highly fluent in search, reference, and content technologies. While much writing is submitted via PDF, the research requires reference and content management. In addition, I am a student in computer programming and aim to build web applications to assist researchers and non-profits compete for funding.</p>

					<p>In addition to writing and editing proposals, manuscripts, white papers, and print and web content, I am also a writer. I have authored news articles and editorials that have been published on websites in the US and the UK.</p>
