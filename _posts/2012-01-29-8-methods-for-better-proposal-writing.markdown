Deadlines are a large part of the stress of proposal writing. Inspired writing does not respond well to a ticking clock. Here are some simple ways to increase your writing excellence  and maintain productivity on a proposal.

1) <strong>Write the important material when you are at your best. </strong>

Funder guidelines often set high standards for content, logic, and persuasiveness. Because most proposals must contain innovative concepts, write original content when you are at your best. It helps to know what sections of the proposal will undergo the most scrutiny and write those when you are intellectually sharp.

<strong>2) Set aside the boilerplate and write to the funder</strong>

Every career advisor cautions job seekers to tailor their resumes to the job description. And prospective employers are turned off by generic applications. The same is true in proposal writing. Funders are engaged by proposals that are specific and unique to their guidelines.  In the rush to meet a deadline, you may be tempted to rely on boilerplate. Don't. Invest the time to write specifically to the funder's requirements.

<strong>3) Read and re-read the guidelines</strong>

Each time you read the guidelines and you write, you will discover a new nuance of the funder's interests. Also, revisiting the guidelines will ensure that your writing has not drifted from the stated requirements.

<strong>4) Let others review and edit your work</strong>

Editors create better writers. If you write without feedback, then you will have missed a great learning opportunity. Having a reviewer that is naive to grant writing, such as a friend, will provide you valuable information about the clarity and focus of your writing.

<strong>5) Always request feedback</strong>

Government feedback usually is limited reviewer comments on scoring. And you will likely not get much information from a foundation. But it is a best practice to solicit feedback when you can. Even the smallest bit of information can help you rethink your proposal writing.

<strong>6) Sweat with the blank page</strong>

Disable your internet connection and write with a blank page. Not only will you be forced to write something new, but you will witness your own creative process. The joy of the blank page is that you will save time searching for good writing outside yourself. Instead, you will discover that you are a capable and original writer.

<strong>7) Focus on the purpose of writing, not only on the beauty of words</strong>

Proposal writing wins investment for a specific purpose. This type of writing is meant to persuade on the basis of the merits of the organization, logic, and approach. Therefore, the writing may not have the snap and urgency of an ACT NOW e-mail blast. Instead, the proposals seeks to forge a partnership, which is tied to a large sum of money. The writing itself is meant to help the reader understand a reasoned argument and logical plan.

<strong>8) Swap drafts and stories with other proposal writers</strong>

Proposal writers work alone, but there are thousands of peers out there willing to swap drafts. As long as you are willing to give something, you will receive in turn. There are repositories of grant proposals on the web, but they lack context. It is better to trade writing with someone who can explain the backstory that went into a proposal. And having a peer network is great for when you are stuck on a writing project.
