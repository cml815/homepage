<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Caroline Leopold, MA, GPC</span></strong></h4>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://leopoldwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/prettyme1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-430" title="prettyme" src="http://leopoldwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/prettyme1-193x300.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="300" /></a></h4>
My expertise is telling stories that connect best practices and research with your work. Few projects are sure winners in a crowded world of other projects. My job is to bring out the best in you using my talent to combine logic, passion, and a fresh perspective.

The number #1 reason proposals fail is because they were significant problems from the beginning. You need to be strong right out of the gate because these grant competitions and contract bidding processes have fierce competition with a strong field.

<strong>What Are Your Chances?</strong> My work generally begins with a free consultation to discuss your eligibility and chances for funding. Estimating your chances is something any ethical consultant will do. Not only will I tell you your chances, but share how you can improve your chances right away. But remember, to succeed, you will have to use your best thinking and planning. And I will work hard alongside you.

<strong>Proposal Writing Services. </strong>My job is to write and do research which frees you to strategize, enlist partners, and gather legal or financial documentation. There is some work I cannot do for you. Remember, I am not you. You and your team are the bosses and I am your trusted professional contractor. However, my writing and background research is designed to make you and your concept look inviting the reviewers and the funding entity.

<strong>Help You Find Funding Sources. </strong>My work enables me to quickly access an array of funding opportunities from the federal government, foundations, and corporations. One grant or contract is likely not enough to implement your vision. I can help you build a "program of funding" with diverse public and private sources.
