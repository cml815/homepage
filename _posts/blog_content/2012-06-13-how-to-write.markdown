<h2>How to write with purpose</h2>
Caroline Leopold

Copy is noticed, read (we hope), and used in some way. Readers respond to all writing, even if it means they steer clear from it. How to write in a manner focused on the audience is a key skill. The evaluation of writing - its quality and worthiness - is a subjective process. But there are ways to distinguish from mediocre to better writing - and bad to terrible copy. This article answers the question on how to write with honesty, clarity, and direction.

Writing is an interaction, even if the writer and reader never know the other. Most writing engages people in distant places and diverse points of view. It augments talk, but in many cases, it is the only means to communicate. Written words have more potential for reshaping, repeating, and sharing. That is why great writing is an ambiguous process. Once, it's delivered to another, it takes it's own life or is quickly forgotten. Then, the question becomes - how to write to spark interest and dialogue?

<strong>Learn the Rule of One </strong>

The formula: <strong><span style="color: #993300;">Good Writing + Strategic Delivery = Intended Result</span></strong>  <span style="color: #000000;">is incomplete. It omits the audience - the reader. The process is more back-and-forth or iterative. Strategic writing can produce multiple results, depending on how many repeat or act upon what you write. For you, that is a great advantage. Your carefully written piece may be shared and talked about, which may create a demand for your services. </span>

How to write for optimal response? First, write with a clear purpose and then, invite audience to respond. It is a myth to believe that good writing will inevitably lead to an action. Both your message and your call to action must be clear and direct. Ask your readers to take one action- buy, share, subscribe, call, or comment. Good writing will inspire in the reader a desire to respond. Even if that means to argue with your point of view.

Remember - stick to the <strong><span style="color: #993300;">Rule of One</span></strong>, which means that you focus on one goal at a time. Write about only <strong>one concept</strong> and give <strong>one action</strong>. Yes, it's difficult to get a precise point across- as opposed to throwing in a mess of ideas and hoping one will stick. But it is infinitely more effective.

The readers who have a stake it what you write matter the most. Often those readers aren't the first to see your writing. But if it's important to them, they will read and evaluate it - through your direct words or how others talk/write about you. Fortunately, you are not helpless to drive the dialogue. What you write sets the stage for later action.

<strong>How to Write to the Point  </strong>

First, you must decide on your one concept. Rather than plucking that idea with a few moments of thought, it better to brainstorm many points. You may want to use concept mapping, which is to write an idea and then draw lines to sub-topics and associated ideas. Then you are able to omit tangents and consolidate main topics. To write to the point requires some sifting of ideas. This is especially true when you are writing an important showcase piece, such as a white paper, landing page, press release, or mission statement. In the illustration, you will discover that this article could have included multiple points. In the end, the Rule of One won out.
