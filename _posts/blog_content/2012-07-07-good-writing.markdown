Text is often the fastest method of communication. As more turn to search engines for their questions, professionals are challenged to meet demand for answers. Top-down methods of communication are virtually extinct, with the field crowded with differing viewpoints.

In the fields of medicine and public health, responsible and clear writing is key. And more than ever, writing is supplemented with video, social media, downloadable give-aways, infographics, and inexpensive apps. Therefore, it is not enough to understand research and have fluency of writing, but writers must achieve visual literacy and technological facility. Writing has become ubiquitous, that virtually every person becomes a writer, at least for a few moments a day.

<strong>What are the features of good writing?</strong>

Good writing engages an intended audience, who is moved to some action. Most often, the goal is to have repeated engagement with audiences that build trust that then becomes a mutual learning experience. A good starting point for trust is following high standards for quality and taking responsibility for the veracity and accuracy of any claim. Writing is similar to scientific discovery in that it may appear tentative. But that is the strength of such writing - it avoids hyperbole and relies on the simplicity of what works.

Plain language works best. Marketing writers understand that they may have a prospect for seconds at a time. When conveying medical or health information, those seconds are precious. Even a slight shift in behavior, may lead to significant health benefits...or losses. Communications research shows that audiences will listen, as long as the speaker has something useful to say. And that leads to the next point...

<em><strong>Good writing reflects sound thinking. </strong></em>Writing can only be as good as the thinking behind it. The reason writing and speech lapses into cliche is because it's rushed. Good writing will take its sweet time as the brain (or many brains) break down the usual patterns and then formulate a new idea. The path from first to last draft often takes looping turns, double-backs, and lots of scrapped copy. The demand for unique and compelling content requires a supply of an intellectually rigorous and creative thought processes. Writing at its best creates something never before seen, and thus, provokes the reader.

<strong><em>Writing is sourced from passion. Â </em></strong>Much ado is made about inspiration, but as Thomas Edison once said, "genius is one percent inspiration and 99% perspiration." Writers' energy is sourced less from fleeting inspiration, but from passion. It may be hard to imagine a writer at a desktop feeling much of anything during a long session of research, writing, editing, and formatting, but there's a drive there. The blank page demands some energy from within, from caring about developing something from nothing. The writer's charge is to find something interesting to say, and if the writer, is indifferent, that will show in boring copy.

Writing has been called art, technique, a medium for a greater purpose, and at times it's called spam. The common threads in all writing is the person (or persons) behind it and the audience that chooses to receive or trash it. Those who achieve as a writer are those who think well, speak plainly, and listen.
