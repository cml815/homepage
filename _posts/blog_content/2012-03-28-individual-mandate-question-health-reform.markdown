  content: How are social security and medicare not unconstitutional? Aren't these mandates for healthcare after 65, along with retirement and disability insurance? I'm not suggesting that medicare and social security be crossed out of course, but I can't seem to wrap my head around the legal issues involved.

<a href="http://leopoldwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/lincoln1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-521" title="lincoln" src="http://leopoldwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/lincoln1-290x300.jpg" alt="Weighty decisions on healthcare" width="290" height="300" /></a>After three days of hearing arguments, the Supreme Court is considering the constitutional issues related to the Affordable Care Act. The constitutionality of the individual mandate, which will require every American to purchase health insurance was a key provision that was under discussion. Whether the individual mandate limits personal liberty is at stake. And a second question, which was debated on Wednesday was whether health reform could survive without an individual mandate.

The political implications of the ruling are apparent. President Barack Obama has staked much of his reputation and standing on Capitol Hill with the landmark legislation. In an election year, his opponents are poised to strike a big win against what they call "Obamacare." Although what is more important to discuss is what reducing or overturning the ACA would mean for health care.

The statistics point to the crisis that motivated the reform. 44 million Americans who do not have health insurance. The American Journal of Medicine released <a title="American Journal of Medicine Study" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/documents/american_journal_of_medicine_09.pdf" target="_blank">a study in 2009</a> that more than 60% of bankruptcies filed were due to medical bills.

Will the constitutionality of the individual mandate bring down the entire ACA?Â Will gains that have been made such as expanding coverage to dependents up to age 26 be reversed? One question that remains is whether ACA can survive without certain pieces or will the 400+ provisions be abandoned.

If not the ACA, then what? More of the same, perhaps - rising premiums, burdens on emergency departments, strapped hospital systems with unbridled insurance industry profits.
