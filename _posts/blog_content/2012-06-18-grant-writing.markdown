The term grant writing doesn't fully describe the entire process of securing grant funding. The following is a outline of the life cycle of finding, applying, and following up on a grant application.
<h3><strong>Plan</strong></h3>
To be competitive, you must have an project or concept that exceeds requirements. A compelling project idea is not enough. You must demonstrate that you have the experience, staffing, and technology to launch the project. And you must submit a detailed, measurable plan to execute your concept. There may be a great deal of planning, research, discussion, and reworking of your concept to make sure it's ready for scrutiny upon review. This planning and readiness process is ideally work you are already doing:

1) Refine your idea against current research and best practices

2) Receive feedback from others and ask them to write a support letter, commit resources, etc.

3) Expand your capacity through technology upgrades, training, new staff and contractors
<h3><strong>Research</strong></h3>
Grant solicitations require more research than writing. Often, grant applications require some review of theory, research, public data, and best practices. Even if research were not required, applicants are served by researching the funder and their giving history to tailor a proposal to the funder. Too much research can create the phenomenon of "paralysis or analysis." Research is meant to strengthen the application and cannot stand on its own. Even proposals for scientific research require original and innovative aims and methods. The following is a list of typical research activities:

1) Read the funder website, application guidelines, press releases, and their public IRS 990 (available for non-profit funders).

2) Seek out other people or organizations, who are doing what you do. How do they conceptualize their work and assess their results and funding sources. You may contact them for advice.

3) Review the published literature for theory and best practices. Be sure to look beyond peer reviewed publications. Funding sources such as government agencies and non-profit think tanks publish their own reports and have their own databases.
<h3><strong>Write</strong></h3>
Writing can be a rushed process due to short deadlines and the need to do a lot of tasks outside of writing. If the logic and evidence are strong, an application can win without having perfect writing. But the writing itself and the budget are the only ways for review committees to assess your qualifications and competitiveness. One challenge is to incorporate the expertise of many into one application.
<h3><strong>Submit</strong></h3>
With federal grant proposals, there is stress and uncertainty as to whether the application will be validated. That is why submitting days or weeks before the deadline is idea. Many funders have a zero tolerance policy toward late or incomplete applications.
