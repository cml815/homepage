title: Teaching on Grants
---

Over the years, I have presented and taught about grant writing, research methods, and statistics. There is a large and eager audience of people, who want to develop skills to advance their work. My presentations have included physician, student, and non-profit audiences. 

In May 2012, I gave a [CME talk](http://ictr.johnshopkins.edu/ictr/2012/05/jhcrn-workshop-overview-of-acquiring-research-grants-may-22.html) to the [Johns Hopkins Clinical Research Network](http://ictr.johnshopkins.edu/JHCRN/). The consortium helmed by Johns Hopkins University is dedicated to helping hospitals surrounding Baltimore participate in clinical research studies. Among the challenges physicians face is not being able to "break into" the world of research grants. With the chilly funding climate at the NIH, this is not surprising.
