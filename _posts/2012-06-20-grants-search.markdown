Out in the world, accessible by electronic technology, are many great finds. The grants search will yield opportunities and news on the latest research breakthroughs and innovative practices. There is no precise best place to start. It is a matter of doing a search using a map of what you know to discover what you want to know.

<strong>Free Funding Opportunity Databases</strong> -  The following is an annotated list of funding opportunity databases:

<a href="http://www.grants.gov">Grants.gov</a> is the portal for all federal grant opportunities. Each of the 26 federal agencies that award grants have past, current, and future grant opportunities listed. The site has basic and advanced search options, but the best use of Grants.gov is when you have a specific opportunity to search. Browsing thousands of opportunities is not a speedy process because the funding opportunity titles tend not to be particularly descriptive. It is recommended to search through the relevant federal agency such as Health and Human Services (HHS), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), etc.

<a title="FedBizOpps" href="http://www.fbo.gov">FBO.gov </a>(or aka FedBizOpps) is the portal for federal contracting opportunities. This site lists current and forthcoming contract opportunities. The site has a simple search interface and has options to create alerts and notifications. Registration is available, but not required for searches.

<a title="Foundation Center" href="http://www.foundationcenter.org">FoundationCenter.org</a> - Foundation Center has a simple search tool to locate a specific funder or a group of funders in a geographical area. There are more sophisticated search mechanisms available, but only by paid subscriptions at levels from $150-$1,500 per year.
