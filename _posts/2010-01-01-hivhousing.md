One core specialty I have is in HIV/AIDS beginning as a research assistant in graduate school. Since then, I have worked on numerous HIV-related writing projects. Among my output:

*Grantwriting leading to $2.5 million in contracts and grants.
*Wrote a chapter to update Speaking Out, a training manual on international MSM and HIV issues.
*Editing and added content to Change It!, a manual on international HIV human rights work.
*Written articles for Med City on latest HIV research.
*Edited a doctoral dissertation on perinatally acquired HIV.

My experience with HIV research and services now spans 16 years. As the epidemic has changed, I have worked to remain current on CDC guidelines and the latest advances. The World AIDS Conference of 2012 vowed to end HIV/AIDS in a generation. With research and action, this is possible.
