Small companies and businesspeople frequently ask about their chances for grants. I reply that their chances are not great.
<blockquote>Forgetta 'bout it.</blockquote>
But there's a more helpful answer. I talk to them about their business and their goals. I help them envision the bigger picture, which is contained within their business plan. Grants can enhance business, but only as investment, not profit.
<h3>Think contracts, not grants</h3>
Grant seeking can distract a business from its source of profit - quality service or products and a satisfied customer base. Sales and contracts are usually more appropriate for businesses than grants. For example, the government is a customer and businesses may bid for contracts. Contracts vary greatly from the federal government working with the defense industry or a local school accept bids from electrical repair companies.

Contracts different from grants in that a contract is full payment for services rendered. A grant is typically money with fewer restrictions, but rarely covers all the cost of work. Grants were geared toward public benefit organizations and institutions: non-profits, universities, tribal governments, and public housing.

Securing contracts has its own difficult process, but information can be acquired locally.  Your search can include terms such as contract procurement, which describes the competitive bid process. Most state and local websites post contract opportunities on their websites.

For example, New York City has the <a title="mocs" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/mocs/html/home/home.shtml" target="_blank">Mayor's Office of Contract Services</a>, procured $15 billion of services from vendors in 2011. To put that figure in perspective, the entire NIH grant budget for the U.S. and the world was about $30 billion in 2011. To find contracting opportunities, search city and state sites, who all are dot gov sites. You can talk with your local elected representative for information, read the local business news, and check websites for new RFPs (requests for proposals) or bidder conferences (public meetings to help vendors bid for contracts).
<h3>Grants work in special cases</h3>
Business owners may benefit from perusing the <a title="sba" href="http://www.sba.gov/" target="_blank">Small Business Administration</a>, which provides articles and has a tool to f<a title="counseling finder sba" href="http://www.sba.gov/local-assistance?ms=nid13710">ind free local counseling</a>. Counseling is free and doesn't require anyone to submit a grant proposal.

The site also has <a title="loans and grants search tool" href="http://www.sba.gov/content/search-business-loans-grants-and-financing" target="_blank">search tool for loans and grants</a>, which yields results based on your answers to a brief survey. The SBA is careful to inform readers that they do not give grant funding, but can query for outside opportunities. Here is a screenshot of the search parameters:

<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
I ran some sample queries and there were few results, mostly from federal agencies. However, I learned that there are housing grants available to build/operate low-income housing, help for homeless veterans, and some funds for crime victims assistance.

<a title="sbir" href="http://leopoldwriting.com/small-business-innovation-research-sbir-explained/" target="_blank">Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)</a>, which is federal grant for business R&amp;D. also emerged from the results. SBIR is one of the only federal grant programs devoted to for-profit research and development activities. These grants can be quite substantial (up to $1 million in Phase II), but the competition is intense.

Also, the I<a title="idea cafe" href="http://www.businessownersideacafe.com/small_business_grants/index.php" target="_blank">dea Cafe offers a $1,000 grant</a> and exposure to forward thinking businesses. Idea Cafe is a for-profit that caters to businesses. As you can guess, the money it gives away is likely small compared to the new business the grant competition attracts.

Its grant program has been designed to build Idea Cafe's visibility and profile among its base. This grant opportunity is an an example of how a business can build its reputation and market its services by providing grant competitions and contests.
<h3>Grant competitions to build business</h3>
Chase and Living Social wanted to build its brand by warding $250,000 in grants to 12 businesses. That money and publicity would be tremendous for small businesses.

I did not apply because my business was too new, small, unoriginal, and lacked entrepreneurial zing. But businesses approached me to write a grant application for them. I did a small writing job for Fur Fitness out in the Los Angeles area. I explained to them the slim chances of winning, but felt they had a shot. Their doggie fitness business seemed competitive because they had a novel concept and a thriving and popular business, which also had an affiliated animal welfare non-profit.

But no one, not even Chase, envisioned the enormity of the competition. In late August, Chase and LivingSocial <a title="chase results" href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20120821005331/en/Chase-LivingSocial-Award-12-Small-Businesses-250000" target="_blank">issued a press release</a> and a <a title="chase page" href="https://www.missionsmallbusiness.com/" target="_blank">web page</a> stating the names of the 12 winners and that nearly 70,000 businesses registered to apply and 3.1 million consumers voted for their favorite businesses. What this means is that applicants had a roughly a 1 in 5,833 chance in winning. This level of odds is more typical of lotteries, not grant competitions. While the 12 grant winners certainly are happy, the real winner is potential business for Chase's small business lending portfolio.

No, Fur Fitness did not win. But like the over 69,000 businesses, they carried on.
