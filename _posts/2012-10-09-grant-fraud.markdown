Former Illinois medical district commissioner, his wife, and two others were indicted last week for stealing at least $3.7 million in state grants earmarked for medical programs for cancer and HIV/AIDS, according to prosecutors.

According to indictment filed on October 4, former commissioner of the Illinois Medical District Leon Dingle Jr., his wife Karin Dingle, Jacquelyn Kirkpatrick and Edmond Clemons purposely defrauded the state of Illinois and three nonprofits from 2004 to 2010. The named parties allegedly secured $11 million in state grant money and diverted at least $3.7 million to personal use.
