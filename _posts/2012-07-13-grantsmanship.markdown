Grantsmanship is the art and technique of grant writing to maximize your chances for success. Grantsmanship focuses on clear logic, quality writing, and submitting supportive documentation to the funders requirements. The purpose of clear writing is to allow the proposal to shine and get the due attention from review committees.

Can superior grantsmanship substantially increase your chances. Yes, but no amount of grantsmanship can salvage a project with methodological or logical flaws.

Grantsmanship is akin to the the final days of training before a major competition, such as the Olympics. Olympians are made through years of training, practice, and execution during competition. To continue the sports analogy, grantsmanship is akin to wearing aerodynamic clothing to shave off by time by fractions of a second. But suiting up in the latest poly blend is going to turn a lolly gagger into a champion.

There may be a temptation to spend too much time in grant editing and word-smithing. A gorgeous proposal that sings with crisp, clear language will expose the good and the weak. Lets spend less time of correcting passive voice and building a more coherent vision. Rather, the critical examination of the overall logic of the project and your team's capacity to carry out your proposal. The truth is that a typo may be embarrassing, but it is not a deal breaker. However, a mistake in project planning can be fatal. For example, you may propose $X budget for a certain number of participants. But if you have neglected to include a justification of the numbers served in the program plan, that is a glaring omission that may knock you out of the running.

Flaws in program planning, methodology, and budgeting can be caught almost as easily as a typo, so long as the proper expert is carefully reading the proposal... twice or three times. Logic errors are best caught through a visualization of the project. An algorithm, logic model, outline, or project work plan are among the excellent methods to map logic and to see the gaps and irregularities. Even a simple drawing on a white board of predictors, activities, and outcomes connected with hand-scribbled arrows will give you an idea of whether the proposal makes sense.

That rigorous review of logic is well and good, except in the real world, there are inherent weaknesses. For example, leadership may be weak or inexperienced in some aspects of the work. A key stakeholder may withhold public support of your project, a public funder slashes its budget, or a major collaborator falls ill, retires, or finds a better job across the country. These unpredictable setbacks are precisely why logic is your greatest asset. A proposal grounded in a sound and reasonable theory of development can survive any number of assaults in execution.

<strong>Recommendations on how to improve logic into your work:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Collaborate with those with experience in execution. If you want to conduct a research project, talk to those already doing the work. They can answer your questions about the obstacles and facilitators of the work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Â Talk to those at upper management and policy levels. These individuals see the big picture about projects and will give you insight on what is most important from a level removed from your work. In addition, they will give you a clue about what excites those who are experienced and perhaps a bit skeptical of front line work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Every concept presented must be back with a theory or research grounding and also is linked to some future activity into the proposal. And also, is included as a budget item. This advice is a good way to winnow down bloated literature reviews that may bury the most current and pressing questions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Where the logic and flow of writing becomes vague, confusing, or awkward is the precise point where a concept has not been fully developed. Writing and rewriting will not fix that problem - only thinking will.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Consult with subject matter experts whenever possible. For example, you are writing a proposal and must address a data encryption and protection. Unless you understand the topic thoroughly, it may appear that you are hiding something with vague language. If you hand the section over to your information systems and security consultant, you will achieve the level of detailed required to satisfy reviewers.</li>
</ul>
In sum, the correction of logic will give your proposal a large advantage over others. This work will tax many to the limits of their patience, especially with competing demands and time constraints. Therefore, it is a matter of prioritizing time - that digging into the logical flaws is more valuable than shaping word choices and redacting commas.
