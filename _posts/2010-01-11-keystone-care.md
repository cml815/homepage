##### Many writing projects have been focused on issues of aging and health. One of my first jobs out of college was organizing senior citizens, so I understood the importance of the work. 

##### Most recently, I have been working with [KeystoneCare](http://www.keystonecare.com) in grant writing for their programs for the terminally ill. Their facility, Keystone House, is one of the only residential facilities that can manage complex health problems and was awarded licensure for inpatient-level care. Their house provides much more dignified and homey care than a hospital, where families can visit their loved ones 24 hours a day. The value is tremendous - quality care at a fraction of the cost. 

##### In addition, I had a medical writing assignment with the [American Physician Institute](http://www.americanphysician.com) related to geriatric medicine. My writing was to provide instruction aid to internal medicine residents sitting for American Board of Internal Medicine exam. The job allowed me to be immersed in the latest research on the chronics diseases of aging that in total affect the majority of older adults - heart disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia/Alzheimers.
