Many feared that medical research and innovation would grind to a halt and they would need to close their labs and studies. The America Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (aka "Stimulus") provided $10 billion in additional research funding, but that money is exhausted. How can researchers forge ahead with their work in times of increased funding for flat or shrinking research dollars?

<strong>Funding more competitive</strong>

NIH Director, Francis Collins, MD, Ph.D. gave an <a title="Francis Collins of NIH talk " href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/24149" target="_blank">honest talk</a> about the NIH's flat budget, which amounts to cuts due to inflation. He estimated that a range of 10-20% of applications get funded, which has increased competition. As a result, more established researchers gain precedence over new investigators and risky projects.
<blockquote>...You’re looking at a pile of grants and amongst them are some very solid applications from very well-established investigators who have a really amazing track record.  And then there’s another pile of new investigators you haven’t heard of...and haven’t published as much.  There is a tendency, I think, to go with the proven entities and that may mean you are missing out on the innovative stuff from the new investigators.  <a title="NIH talk" href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/24149" target="_blank">[Source: Francis Collins, MD, Ph.D. How the Recession Has Affected Medical Research]</a></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">The increased competition may discourage physicians and early researchers from submitting their applications. And further, the likelihood of rejection of a first attempt is high. The costs of resubmitting even the most worthy application is high, which deters researchers, who have lean budgets.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Strategies to maximize grant success</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The NIH remains the largest global biomedical funder at about $28 billion per year to 3,000 institutions. The NIH, nor other entities dedicated to grant funding will not disappear. The researcher can gain comfort in that the survival of funders depends on their grantee researchers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apply where you have the best chance</span>. The NIH, NSF, and other public and private grantmakers release funding opportunities tailored to early career researchers. In addition, the NIH has less stringent <a title="NIH percentiles, paylines, impact scores" href="http://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2011/02/15/paylines-percentiles-success-rates/" target="_blank">payline (metric on expectation of funding)</a> for its new investigators applying for R01 grants.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apply for exploratory grants.</span> Some grant competitions are designed for pilots, feasibility studies, and other preliminary work. Researchers who wish to develop preliminary data and build their research can benefit from these competitions.</p>
3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Narrow the research focus.</span> Exceptional research proposals contain an insightful analysis of the problem, a clean methodology, and outcomes that fit well into the specialty. Many research aims and hypotheses may make for a dynamic research program, but can be a nightmare to execute in a short time period. Strategy in research design can develop a small study that has larger impact.

4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Embrace rejection.</span> Among fiction writers there is a saying, "You become a real writer when you receive your first rejection." In grants, it's the exact same process. Rejection is inevitable and the learning from that first rejection is invaluable. Savvy researchers understand that a rejection is the map to future success. For those who receive repeated rejections, then they need to step back and talk to an advisor, who has a history of research funding.

<strong>Moving Forward</strong>

There are no guarantees in the quest for research funding, but it is a well-defined pathway. No researcher can secure grants on their own. They rely on their institution, mentors, peer investigators, the larger research community and from the funding entities themeselves. A sensible starting point is to seek guidance as you develop your research grant proposal.  Despite warnings of competition, there is a <em>esprit de corps</em> in the research community. Harness that resource and success is on step closer.
