Have you ever wondered how many words you write in a day, week, or your entire career? Pinning down a number is difficult because I often write all day, every day, but for different purposes. When I am in a volatile discussion on a forum, easily I can write 5,000 words in a day. But that is my "fun" writing. Or maybe it's the writing I use to distract me from my real work.

And there is the writing relegated to cut and delete. What proportion of your writing do you delete without a second thought? How often have you spent an hour on Word, only to redact most of what you have written? I easily chop 50% of my writing, without reserving it for future use. It's the modern equivalent of snatching a page from a type writer, balling it up, and hurling it into the trash.

1,000,000 Words
------------

My career word count includes writing that made it into someone else's hands for some use. My greatest productivity is in my trade - proposals - but there are reports, newsletters, e-blasts, press releases, and an occasional speech. My low ball estimate is 1,000,000 words . Not all of those words yielded funding, but a lot of them made over the hurdle in their 2nd, 3rd, or 11th try. Time to break out my calculator here. One million words would fit 1,667 single-spaced pages in familiar Times New Roman, 12 point font. That is a textbook or a Stephen King thriller.

**Calculating a Word's Worth**

Now, for the fun part. Calculating return on investment. Each of my words averaged $8 because I have raised $8 million in grants, contracts, and individual donations. That's greatly distorted because only a small percentage of the words had a tremendous yield. The rest of the words were goofing off and cost money. As for how much I was paid for my work - 6 cents per word - as a career non-profit and freelance writer. That's pre-tax.

I'm not certain what any of this math means. Except that I know my words have impact and value in the marketplace. This inspires me as I struggle to understand my position as a freelancer and consultant.
