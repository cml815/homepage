Marketing writers adopt the latest methods to attract attention and build an audience. Their goal is to have the reader spend enough time on the communication to take any sort of action: subscribe, comment, buy, donate, etc.

Technological advances and increased competition for dollars has had the opposite effect on contract and grant proposal writing. Dense proposals stripped of any semblance of a readable style.

The trends in this field include:
<ul>
	<li>Proposals required to use same font, size, spacing, margins.</li>
	<li>Many RFPs require use of the funder's outline and header wording.</li>
	<li>Stricter page limits - often shorter than the RFP itself.</li>
	<li>Online submissions forms that deny any Word formatting (e.g., italics, bullet points).</li>
	<li>Limits on attachments, if any.</li>
</ul>
Following the requirements of a competitive call for proposals often means that all the organizing design elements have been stripped. And the words, paragraphs, and transitions themselves are the only frame to present the argument.

On one level, it is liberating to not have to worry about design elements in a proposal. The addition of colorful photographs, graphs, and tables can detract from the time it take to develop a cogent argument. However, the reader has no cues to anchor focus, unless one dares to use ALL CAPS.

<h4><strong>How Does Plain Jane Get Noticed?</strong></h4>
<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>#1 Best Solution, Use Numbers</strong></span>

Numbers are triple threats in a proposal: 1) eye catching, 2) parse a complex line of reasoning, and 3) quantify performance goals and objectives. Readers are automatically  drawn to numbers because they are novel elements in a paragraph. And numbers can be a succinct explanation of prior success, capacity, and measurable objectives. Numbers can serve as a simple design element by breaking up a paragraph or highlighting key points.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Caution:</strong></span> External, expert data requires citation for authority and verification. Internal, goal-oriented data must be consistent, logical, and reasonable.

<strong><span style="color: #800000;">Redundancy Diminishes Message </span></strong>

Generally, it is helpful to restate the most central elements in your proposal. However, repeating phrases verbatim is not the best approach.  Many writers (myself included) become too attached with our phrasing. Certain concepts we developed over dozens of drafts and know them by heart. Therefore, it is tempting to push them on the page, like stand-ins in a movie shoot.

Personally, I use what I know about learning theory in writing. No person can understand a new idea in one sitting. Proposal reviewers are similar in that they start with their standpoint and then integrate your point-of-view as they become familiar with your ideas. Thus, it's advisable to introduce yourself first through the funders lens (usually the RFP, FOA, etc.) and then introduce more detailed information later on.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Take Away Advice</strong></span>: Weave your key theme and concepts through the proposal with increasing depth and detail.

<span style="color: #800000;"><strong>Write Freely, Edit Later</strong></span>

Avoid the temptation to limit your creativity by strict page, word, and character limits. Write with abandon in the beginning. Writing is thinking, thus, cannot be fettered by any rule that limits the creative process. The first draft may exceed the page limits because there is an abundance of ideas, data, plans, goals, and anticipated impact of your proposed idea. Personally, I exceed limits by about 100-150%, which is due to my preference for editing than to let any idea remain unexplored. On the negative side, this over-spilling is due to my bad habit of rewriting my precious concept in new words (which I called myself out on earlier).

Editing hurts because entire sentences, paragraphs, or sections are redacted. For a while, I was too invested in what I wrote that I'd keep files of cut writing for future use. I was never used any of that writing, but I was afraid to <em><strong>delete forever</strong></em>.  Merciless editing is necessary because tangential arguments will crowd out those essential points to make a case.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Remember</strong></span>: Cutting that extraneous, but beautiful paragraph makes room for focused writing to grow.
