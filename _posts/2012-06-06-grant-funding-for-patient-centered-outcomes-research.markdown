With great anticipation, over $100 million has been earmarked for clinical research focused on improved health outcomes, better health systems, and improved communications and IT structures.

While the amount of funding is underwhelming compared to available funding through the NIH and industry sources, these funding announcements allows researchers to present ideas to peer review especially friendly to clinical research.

PCORI announced today in a pre-application webinar that there will be multiple cycles of application and funding with the first cohort of winners receiving 3-year grants upwards of $500,000 in January of 2013.

It's not too late to apply for funding in the first cycle. The mandatory Letter of Intent is due by electronic application on Friday, June 13th. There is an informational webinar scheduled for Wednesday, June 13 at 3:00 pm Eastern Standard Time. For more information on the funding opportunities and application guidelines, please visit the PCORI web site <a title="PCORI web site" href="http://www.pcori.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.
