Many people make a steady income in writing. What people say in public about their earnings, hours, and ease of start-up is of varying credibility. There is information out there about how hard your fellow writers are working and what they are earning.
<h4>Writing Pays Well, but not <strong>That</strong> Well</h4>
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is a crucial source for overviews of specific occupations and industries. In the <a title="BLS writer" href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos320.htm">Author, Writers, and Editors section</a> of the 2010-2011 Occupation Handbook, they report median salary of $53,050 with 50% of writers earning between $38,000 to 75,000. These salaries were gleaned from full-time work, not freelance earnings. <a title="Occ Hand Tech Writers" href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos319.htm">Earnings for technical writers</a> are higher, with software publishers earning the most at $71,000.

The income numbers generated by sites such as <a title="Glassdoor" href="http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm">Glassdoor.com</a> and <a title="salary.com" href="http://salary.com/mysalary.asp">Salary.com</a> provide more specific information on location, company, and job title. Glassdoor's full list of writer salaries runs the gamut from a television writer earning $180,000 down to writers making $8 an hour. The full search is <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/writer-salary-SRCH_KO0,6_SDAS.htm">here</a>.

Six figure salaries sound great, but aren't realistic. Brian Nelson of Arctic Llama sensibly argues that if a writer wasn't earning 100,000 in full-time work, they aren't going to make that freelance. <a href="http://www.arcticllama.com/blog/beingafreelancer/how-much-does-a-freelance-writer-get-paid/">His cogent blog piece is here</a>.
<h4>Calculate Your Optimal Rate</h4>
It is not difficult to do the math and calculate an hourly fee. In a United States regular office job, you have 2080 hours to work with the assumption that you work 40 hours and have 2 weeks vacation. In freelance, those available hours can expand or contract as you wish. <a title="Freelance switch calculator" href="http://freelanceswitch.com/rates/">Freelance Switch has an excellent calculator</a>, in which you enter expenses, billable hours, and profit. Then the calculator provides you an optimal and liveable rates.

<strong>The Kicker: The Quest for Work is Work</strong>

In David Mamet's epic play and screenplay Glengarry Glen Ross, top salesman Blake declares, "A-B-C: Always be closing." Applied to freelance writing, the goal is winning a contract to write X and be paid Y. The scramble to find paying projects is a continuous effort for the any freelancer. And the writer ends up with 2 jobs: paid writing and unpaid marketing and job prospecting.

<strong>The Goal: Keep the Rates and the Output High</strong>

Scoring as much high yield work and paid hours is the goal. However, the chaos of pulling in jobs and managing the existing workload can cloud the true rates of your writing work. It is worthwhile to throw in values that cannot be assigned a monetary category - work satisfaction, intellectual challenge, learning, and independence. The benefits of working for oneself may possibly be worth less income. For now.
