If you read any popular print or online magazine, there will be a sensational headline with a story about how you can change your life. The billion dollar self-help publishing industry backs many of its claims with citations of academic research. This article will provide a primer on understanding the basics of research and give ideas on how to evaluate the strength of the claims.

<strong>The 5 Ws (&amp; one H)</strong>

A basic principle of journalism that applies to reports of research in the popular media must answer the following questions:

Who? -- Who conducted the study? Who were the study participants?
When? -- When was the study conducted? When were the results released?
Where? -- Was the study done in a university, hospital, or community setting? What country?
Why? -- What questions was the research trying to answer?
and How? -- What was the process of the study? 
&nbsp;

<strong>Applicability</strong>. Many popular magazines cite university studies conducted with college student volunteers. While it is acceptable to work with this population, it is also a convenience sample that may not be similar to the general population. One concept of research, generalizability, is how well research findings can be applied to other groups. Some research has been criticized for using male participants, which may not be applicable to women.

<strong>Sample size</strong>. In research, the number of participants in a study is central to whether the research has the power to detect effects. In a small study, it is hard to discern effects and be sure that they aren't due to individual differences. On the other hand, large studies tens of thousands of people are likely to detect some effect, but the actual effect may be small. 

<strong>Validity</strong>. This concept generally means does what is being studied actually being studied. A lay person can apply logic in understanding validity. Does the research questions and results apply to the main question? 

<strong>Anecdotal data</strong>. This is a type of data that many people use in every day life. For example, someone may ask whether it is better for weight maintenance to eat 5 small meals a day or 3 larger ones. A testimonial of a person (or of an entire website) espousing the personal benefits of eating X number of meals is anecdotal data. A preponderance of a large number of anecdotal reports may provide some foundation for an informed judgment. Although, it may serve to reinforce a myth. 

Research can have value to a consumer audience, but critical reading of what is published will give you information of news you can use. And of news that have no effect, or worse, harm.
