title: Grants for youth development through sport
---

For 6 months, I served as a temporary grant writer for [Legacy Youth Tennis & Education](http://www.legacyyte.org), which provides innovative youth development through the sport of tennis. The organization gain great inspiration from African-American tennis player Arthur Ashe, who cofounded a program that is an ancestor of the current organization. 

While there, I worked on 20 grants to foundations, corporations, and the City of Philadelphia. There were many inspiring moments, including Legacy winning an increased grant from Campbell's Soup for their programs in Camden, NJ. This is an exemplar of what I do best, which is help outstanding organizations improve their grant applications. 

I would go to Legacy twice per week on their gorgeous tennis facility in East Falls. There were always children volunteering, doing their homework, or chatting. In that milieu, I was continually inspired. You can check out their [website](http://www.legacyyte.org) and see the pictures and read the stories. Youth development is a serious matter, but kids can have fun while they challenge themselves and learn.
