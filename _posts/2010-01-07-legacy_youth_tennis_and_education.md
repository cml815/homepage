title: Grants for youth development through sport
---

For 6 months, I served as a temporary grant writer for [Legacy Youth Tennis & Education](www.legacyyte.org), which provides innovative youth development through the sport of tennis. The organization gain great inspiration from African-American tennis player Arthur Ashe, who cofounded a program that is an ancestor of the current organization. 

While there, I worked on 20 grants to foundations, corporations, and the City of Philadelphia.
