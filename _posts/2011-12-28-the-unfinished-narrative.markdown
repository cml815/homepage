Often I write and send a proposal before it meets my standards of writing elegance. By necessity of deadlines, I triage the most important aspects of the proposal - the logic, evidence, and required technical elements. Word smithing a proposal through 20 finely edited rewrites is not possible. Nor is it sane. Proposal writing is a volume business with treacherously short deadlines.

Often I revisit a narrative to use it as a starter to write another proposal. And in the next project, the writing becomes tighter, less elliptical, and more vivid. The rule of editing becomes apparent over multiple incarnations of an idea, but each progression has an "ugly duckling" character to it.

However, the draw back of not writing fresh is I become too committed to ideas I had already developed. Embedded in writing are original concepts that spark new policy directions, programs, or campaign ideas. Those original ideas can be explored over the course of a 1-3 year writing cycle. But fresh data and ideas must find their way in to proposals.

In my early years of grant writing, I referred to some of my as putting old wine into new bottles. Now, I cringe at the thought. Nothing should be exactly the same as it had been the year before.Â Even if the staff, salaries, services, and budget remain exactly the same, much has changed. Outcomes and evaluation will reveal how the program met a need or not quite got there.

The political and economic context continually changes. When budgets are flat, that means the agency has been stressed to do more with less. Any person investing into a home or retirement knows that $100 dollars now is much more than the same $100 bill years down the road.

On reflection, no narrative I ever submit is truly finished. Metaphorically, it is a snapshot in a complex process that continues to move.
