Housing is number #1, non-medical need among people with HIV/AIDS. In Philadelphia, about 12,000 people with HIV are homeless or on the brink of losing their homes. A $1.3 million federal grant proposal submitted to Housing and Urban Development served as a strategic plan to develop 20 units of permanent housing for chronically homeless people with HIV.

The Philadelphia Harbor Project is underway provides permanent housing to those in greatest need and lessen the burden on the shelter and emergency health systems in Philadelphia.
