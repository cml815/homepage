For those starting on the path to securing funds, there are pitfalls and myths about the grants process. You may have heard these before, thus, here's a refresher.

**Think Benefits not Grants**
Yes, government grants are a $500 billion dollar industry, but benefits is how average citizens gain assistance.

Many people do not have to compete to get money to pay for basic needs. Instead, they can sign up and receive cash, food, medical, child health, disability, and unemployment benefits. Â Public benefits and entitlements are available for any one who is eligible.

**Go to [Benefits.gov](http://www.benefits.gov) for more information.**

**Think Loans and Contracts not Grants**
Small business start-up is expensive. And many agree that small business deserves grant support. The government will more likely give you a loan or a contract opportunity than a grant. The Small Business Administration (SBA.gov) is the big daddy for small businesses. And right on their web site, they state there are no grants for small business.

But...

The SBA will point you to any information you need. For free. On the local level, Small Business Development centers will counsel you and keep you on a sensible path.

And...

There are many opportunities for contracting with the government. You can't get a free grant from the government, but they'll pay you to work for them. Check out [Fed Biz Opps](http://www.fbo.org) for more information.

**Partner with Grant Winners**

No need to do the same thing a neighbor is doing down the street. Team up. Partner with grant winners by being a subcontractor, paid staff, or even volunteer. Learn from others and let them mentor you. Many grants and contracts prefer collaboration. Once you are known as a contractor who delivers, then more opportunities will open up.

**Follow Your Dream and the Money Will Follow**

This adage is true in the competitive world of grants. Many people work on their dream on the pennies they can find. It may take many years to win a sizable grant, therefore, you must love this work first and foremost. It is far easier to get a grant for an idea that a funder can see, than a plan on paper. Yes, many win grants with great plans, but they also have a track record for past success.
