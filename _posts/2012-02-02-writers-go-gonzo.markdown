It is time that technical style Writers go gonzo. Embrace a spirit of irreverence and put yourself and your weirdness into your words.

Gonzo conjures up an image of the madcap journalism made famous by the late Hunter S. Thompson. Fact, fiction, and hallucinatory fantasy are interwoven into a news story that is both informative and subjective. Thompson also instigated events and become a central figure in the news stories he was covering. While his approach may have been self-serving, it was also highly entertaining. Gonzo journalism demonstrates how one original mind can influence in a depressing level of injustice and stupid in national politics.

<strong>Get in a Gonzo mood</strong>

Hallucinogenics are not necessary to channel insouciant and brazen writing. Insomnia from a graveyard shift writing session mixed with too much coffee or Red Bull can generate the same effect. This attitude is best cultivated not at the keyboard, but rather as one is pacing about what to write.  Banish the notion of writer's block. Gonzo writers don't get stuck, rather they launch into some sort of stratosphere of intellectual exploration. You aren't staring at the computer monitor and doing nothing. You are marshaling all the weirdness within you to spew it onto the page. It's akin to creating a mighty ball of spit in a parched mouth. It takes a big wind-up, but the resulting projectile is like a phlegmy comet arcing across the sky.

<strong>Gonzo is a brain spill  </strong>

Gonzo writing takes much time to create, but in its totality seems like a careening brilliance of unexpected ideas.  The exact wording is edited later as if it were an effortless task. What's more important is to splat, splat, splat on the keyboard and let spell check tidy the mess up later. As Ann Lamott famously advises, "Write shitty first drafts." And to add the Gonzo twist, write drafts with shit - with the anger, disbelief, and evil glee within you.

<strong>Gonzo doesn't imitate</strong>

The writers any pimply teen or awkward adult want to emulate such as Thompson, Ginsberg, and Burrows, or [name your idol here], have certain signifiers that are tempting to lift. But adopting a certain style such as iambic pentameter doesn't make you Shakespeare. It's okay to cadge other people's tics and mannerisms, but to go Gonzo, you must be offensively weird and original. Whether it's your obsession with a topic that 3 people care about or your loud and ranty opinions, you've got to own that. You must go mad. Go off the deep end. Etc. Being original will not make you popular, but it will make you original.

<strong>Readers appreciate refreshing, especially if written well</strong>

Good writing makes people gasp and, for a few seconds, readers become alive again. Mass culture has made us all fuzzy, numb, and vague. Interesting and unique content is like a striking appearance. It is impossible not to stop and appreciate something unusual, but also pleasing. The easiest cheat is to write well, in that old school way of 40 drafts. The way people who write those things called books do it.

<strong>But for the love of God, say something</strong>

Say something real that bubbled from a crucible of real life, not faux angst. People will love you if you say, "I don't know." Write what people want to say, but are afraid of offending their spouse, boss, neighbor, or house plant. U.S. culture is a gigantic artifice and internet is populated by people saying easy to swallow stuff so you will buy their product. People would rather you talk about them, than yourself. While Gonzo comes across as narcissistic, it's not. It's an anti-hero story where the reader can ride the back of the writer. While the writer trots along, the reader is atop, bouncing and watching the sights. The reader wants to be the hero and the writer's job is to strap them in, pull the lever, and time the ride.

<strong>What's the point</strong>

The point for me is simple. To become a better (ie. more dementedly anti-normal) person. I'm a writer and it's what I do. But I want it to better reflect who I want to become. And to elbow at the boundaries to breathe better. For myself and any hapless person who stumbled upon this screed.
