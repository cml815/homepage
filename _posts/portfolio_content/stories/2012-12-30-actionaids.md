Permanent Housing for People with HIV
===

**Need:** Permanent housing has been demonstrated to lengthen life and improve health of people with HIV. Yet, half of people with HIV/AIDS in Philadelphia have housing needs. Those who have the most unstable housing also have the highest rates of HIV. Thus, housing improves health and also is key in prevention.
              
**Challenge:** Expand effective "housing first" models in Philadelphia to include people with HIV/AIDS, who are chronically homeless. Putting people in housing quickly and then providing wraparound services has proved effective in numerous studies. Housing first has endorsement from HUD and leaders in HIV care. But Philadelphia required that homeless persons with HIV to be in treatment before the could receive AIDS housing subsidy. This was a substantial barrier to housing and AIDS care.
           
**Goal:** Demonstrating housing first works with people who were the hardest to reach-- chronically homeless with mental health and/or substance abuse. Also, the project served to break down funding silos and fragmentation that makes housing less efficient and effective.

				
**Collaborative for Change:** In a major collaborative effort, the Office of Housing and Community Development (OHCD) partnered with [ActionAIDS](http//www.actionaids.org) and Pathways to Housing PA to pilot the first housing first program specifically targeted to people with HIV/AIDS and chronically homeless. They submitted a proposal to HUD's "Special Projects of National Significance." 

**Result:** HUD chose not to fund the project, likely because the application did not have major endorsement from the Philadelphia Housing Authority. However, the project was unbeatable and the proposal was resubmitted to the city. OHCD became a champion for a proposal it worked so hard to help build. The City awarded the project $1.1 million in HOPWA formula funds. In 2012, 20 single adults were placed in scattered, site 1 bedroom apartments.  
           
**Lessons Learned:** Even the best project with the strongest leadership get rejected. But good programs are unstoppable due to persistence and passion. Multi-level collaboration makes for exceptional projects, due to the inclusion of diverse expertise and effort.
