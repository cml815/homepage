The most frequent reason grant applications are declined is because of eligibility. Or that the application was not a good fit for the funding opportunity. In the rush to meet a deadline, it is easy to miss the fine print about eligibility. Here are the major criteria to assess your chances among the competition.

<strong>Rule Out First</strong>

It is best to approach funding announcements with skepticism. Most announcements will not apply to your project. Funders have narrow guidelines because they have limited funds and want to give grants targeted to their particular interest area. To protect your time, it is best to skim the announcement for "rule out" criteria. Try to find language that will knock you out of the running such as:

1) Is the funder looking to give to government, an organization or an individual?

Funders have strict criteria about what entities are eligible for awards. When funding entities hand over a large sum of money, they require strict accounting and reporting. As a result, most grant awards go to organizations such as non-profits, universities, government bodies, or tribal government, rather than individuals. The main exceptions to individual grants include researchers, artists, and students.

2) Are in located in their preferred geographic area?

Many funders have geographic limits on their funding. Some funders may be national, but also have a local focus. For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has a special interest in the Seattle area. Keep in mind that locally focused organizations rarely get grants when the focus is national. Some organizations and individuals traverse geographic areas, which can hurt their chances because a funder can't pigeonhole them. When in doubt, contact the funder for clarification.

3) Does the funder specifically exclude you?

Funders often list exclusions and that list is important to read. Funders vary by exclusions and you may be surprised to find your work on that list. Some of the exceptions you may find:

No funding for research, publications, or conferences
Organizations with high amounts of government or United Way funding are ineligible
No grants for fundraisers, sponsorships, benefits, walk-a-thons, etc.
No funding for single disease organizations
No funding for lobbying
No funding for religious purposes
Restrictions on the size of the organization

<strong>Rule In Next</strong>

If you have read the announcement and haven't encountered any reasons not to apply, then you can review the guidelines to see if you are a fit. Here are some questions to guide your analysis.

1) Does your initiative address their interest areas?

Determining match takes some judgement because many funders have broad guidelines. Health funding is a broad subject that may include research, equipment, care, prevention, and much more. The best way to assess fit is to find wording that gives specific information. If you want research funding, the guidelines will most likely describe research. If your target population are children under the age of 12, then you want to find wording about that.

2) Do you have the capacity or experience to be competitive?

If your organization budget is small, then large grants may be difficult to get without a collaborating agency. Government and foundation funders do not want to be the main funder for an organization. In grant applications, you will be asked for documentation of your capacity. For an organization, it may mean audit reports, 990s, program data, a list of the Board of Directors, and budgets. Individuals may be required to submit a CV, publications list, letters of support from mentors, or other evidence of ability and achievement.

3) Do you have any connection with the funder?

There is an adage that "people give to people," which is no different in the grants world. Breaking into these communities may less difficult because they are often based on performance. If you are building a public reputation of excelling in your field, you can network with funders simply by explaining what you do and why it's important. Remember that your network extends beyond yourself. Your university or organization and your contacts may have networks. Board members and faculty advisors often have relationships with segments of the funding community. Web sites, LinkedIn, Facebook group pages, Twitter, discussion boards allow people to network widely.

<strong>Final Advice: ALWAYS Contact the Funding Prospect</strong>

Do your best effort to contact the grantmaker. Always. There are many, "Yes, but" retorts for this, but simply do it. Even the federal government picks up the phone, although you may be spared that because they usually have teleconferences and are open to taking questions by email. The NIH is especially helpful and they want you to call a Program Officer. They beg you to call so that you have a better shot at making an appropriate submission. There are some procedures of neutrality to keep in mind. In many state and local government bidding processes, they have limits about what they will tell you. Get ready to have the RFP repeated to you verbatim. Don't be afraid to contact a funder - before, during, after a solicitation.
