##### I helped the owners of [Fur Fitness](www.furfitnessfoundation.org) submit an application with the Chase Challenge. Over the time, I worked with a business owner, whose enthusiasm was infectious. I am a huge fan! They weren't awarded one of the grants, but it was incredibly competitive. Over 40,000 applied for 12 grants. The benefit of the project is it helped them clarify what their appeal is as a niche business that also has an animal welfare philosophy. Their business has a non-profit organization, the Fur Fitness Foundation, which raises awareness of obesity risk in animals, as well as their "pet parents."
