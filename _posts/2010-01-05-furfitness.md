##### I helped the owners of [Fur Fitness](http://www.furfitnessfoundation.org) submit an application with the Chase Challenge. The owners developed both a business and a charitable organization devoted to animal health. Over the time I worked with Melissa, founder and co-owner, I was inspired by her infectious enthusiasm. I am a huge fan! 

##### Fur Fitness wasn't awarded one of the grants in this highly competitive challenge. Over 40,000 applied for 12 grants. Only 3 out of 10,000 applicants won the Chase Challenge- lottery odds. In competitions like these, applicants cannot put all their hopes in funding. Instead, they use the process to develop strategy, goals, and how they will sustain their work even without a grant. 

##### Fur Fitness' owners articulated their goals as a viable business that also has an animal welfare philosophy. They continue to gain strength and build recognition about obesity in animals and their "pet parents." If you want to see the human and furry faces behind their thriving business, check out their website and Facebook page.
