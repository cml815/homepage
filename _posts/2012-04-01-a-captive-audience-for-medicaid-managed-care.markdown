Turning state Medicaid programs over to managed care is not new.

Since the 1990s, the states have turned to Medicaid-funded service managed care companies under the motto of "quality care, lower cost." This trend has been accelerated with the passage of the Affordable Care Act and states finding ways to reduce their burdened budgets.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) reported as of December 31, 2010, <a title="Medicaid Managed Care trends" href="https://www.cms.gov/MedicaidDataSourcesGenInfo/downloads/2010Trends.pdf" target="_blank">71% of the 56 million Medicaid population</a> was enrolled in managed care. The numbers enrolled in Medicaid have grown substantially in recent years leading to pressure from a budgetary standpoint to expand managed care. The economic recession swelled Medicaid's rolls as the unemployed lost health insurance for themselves and their families.

Florida is most recently in the spotlight for its effort to cut Medicaid spending and turn the administration to managed care companies. A recent story, <a title="FL Medicaid" href="http://healthystate.org/2012/03/the-financial-state-of-floridas-medicaid/" target="_blank">The Financial State of Florida's Medicaid</a>, was skeptical about the real savings that Florida's initiative would have. Because the federal government matches Florida Medicaid funding, the proposed Medicaid cuts would yield less state savings. In addition, critics charge that reports on Medicaid savings that preserve patient care have not yet been established.

As those requiring Medicaid continue to grow and as state budgets remain flat, the managed care companies have been seizing opportunities to build their Medicaid service base. However, it will take time to discover the true nature, benefits, and drawbacks of this strategy for patient care and long-term health.
