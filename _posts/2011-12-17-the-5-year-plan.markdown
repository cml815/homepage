Where will you be in 5 years?
================

Whenever I hear that question, no crisp vision crystallizes in my mind. Much can happen in 5 years, including a rupture in a continuous trek toward a goal.

For grant writing, 5 years often signifies an end in funding. Multi-year grant funding follows a 3-5 year timeline. Often foundations want a break from their grantees after 5 years of continuous grant funding. Not a break up, but a break where the foundation can see other non-profits.

For grants on the federal or local level, five years is usually the maximum payout for one grant. Or for Congressional authorization for categorical funding. However, reapplication and renewal funding may be available for another cycle, although an administration can turnover in 2-4 years.

The simplest answer I can find, the one that probably rings truest in my professional and personal life:

     I will be in an unexpected place,
-----------------------------
     doing not wholly expected things.
-----------------------------

One thing that continues to astound me is that while technology and innovation advances, we cannot abandon tradition. Many grant opportunities can still be found by calling a family foundation's phone number that you will find in a directory. Not every funder has yet built their web site, yet there assets are intact and their Trustees still meet twice a year.

Today, I was reading about a competitive contract opportunity and the method of presentation were 8 copies in hard bound binders. Yes, three ring binders. I thought I was hallucinating, but there it was. Why should I be surprised? I still submit contract proposals and 10 copies to government offices. And on delivery, the reception staff inks a receipt and hands it to me. And then I tack the receipt to my bulletin board.

As grant writers, we are goal driven and able to think at least 18 months ahead of time. We can read the latest new on appropriations and read foundation giving forecasts on Foundation Center. Yet, I remain a terrible prognosticator. When the present arrives, I find myself doing things slightly different than before. Perhaps, that is how change manifests itself. In one tiny action at a time.
