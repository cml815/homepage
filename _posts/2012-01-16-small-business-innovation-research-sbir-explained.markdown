Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants provide short-term capital to develop a product, concept, or technology concept. SBIR are a rarity in the business world in that these are grants and not loans. The purpose of these federal funds are to encourage new marketable ideas that not only have commercial value, but have public benefit. Funding is distributed in two phases.

General Eligibility: Open to for-profit businesses who are largely based in the U.S. and 51% run by citizens. Must meet criteria of a small business, which generally means less than 500 employees (exact number varies). That business must be doing the majority of the work, although sub-contracting is allowed.

	-Phase I grants are $150,000 to test the technical merit and feasibility of a concept. Grant period is only <strong>6 months</strong>.
	-Phase II grants are up to $1,000,000 for Phase I winners for further research and development.</li>
	-Phase III is for commercialization built on R&amp;D. Not funded by SBIR, but other grants and contracts.</li>

Finding Open SBIR Grant Opportunities
-----------------

While the Small Business Administration (SBA) maintains the [SBIR](http://www.sbir.gov) web page, it is not involved in the grant process. To find SBIR grant opportunities, the simplest way to begin is on the SBA managed "Open/Future Solicitations" page found [here](http://sbir.gov/solicitations).  The full announcement is found on the [Grants.gov site] (http://www.grants.gov) or on the parent agency site (e.g., HHS, DOD). While these federal sites have navigation menus and search engines, the fastest approach is Googling the solicitation number and agency.

Keep in mind that federal agencies have sub-agencies that administer SBIR. For example, the National Institutes of Health which is focused on health, biomedical, and biotech has multiple SBIR opportunities. And the NIH itself is made up of 27 Institutes or Centers and some of them have SBIR opportunities. The full list of 11 federal agencies that give SBIR grants is listed [here](http://www.sbir.gov/about/about-sbir).

How to Apply (and Reapply)
-------------------
It takes persistence to understand how the federal government structures operate, but key to applying is finding the Full Announcement and downloading the entire application. These grants are among the most competitive of all federal grants. The NIH's SBIR program funds less than 10% of applications, which are submitted by an expert talent pool of entrepreneurial physicians and research scientists.

Examining the abstracts and credentials of winning SBIR applicants will help you determine what technologies were considered superior. The NIH has the [RePORT database](http://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm), which will information and abstracts about every NIH grant award.

If you plan to apply for SBIR, be prepared for rejection and then revise and resubmit a stronger application. Most grant winners aren't successful with their first submission, but have a better chance the next time around. Read reviewer comments carefully and integrate their feedback into the next application.
