The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded Children's Crisis Treatment Center in Philadelphia a $300,000 grant to address trauma among West African children who survived civil war. The Tamaa program provides hope and healing for children, who had fled their home countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. These children, who survived war still faced further in resettling in Southwest Philadelphia.
