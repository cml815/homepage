I contribute stories about medicine and public health for [Med City News](www.medcity.com). 

My author page is linked [here](http://medcitynews.com/author/cleopold/). 

Most of the topics I cover are in the arena of public health, HIV, and cancer.

With every story, comes research usually in the form of a PubMed search. The writing helps me stay current with the latest developments in healthcare and medicine.
