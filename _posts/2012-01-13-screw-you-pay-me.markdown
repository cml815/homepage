<a href="http://vimeo.com/22053820?utm_source=swissmiss">F*ck You, Pay Me</a>The provocative headline of this post comes from the title of a talk, Mike Monteiro, Design Director and Co-founder of Mule Design Studio. The video is a riveting 40 minute "wake up" intervention to help web designers, creatives, and writers protect themselves and their work.

Monteiro - vaguely reminiscent of Hunter Thompson- has his attorney, Gabe Levine, along to make remarks. However, Levine doesn't offer Gonzo style lawyering, but sensible and important advice. The take away lessons:

1) Never start work until you sign a well-designed contract

2) Don't blindly sign a contract your Client provides. Look the over and negotiate.

3) The Client should not have ownership of the work until the last payment clears.

4) If the scope of services change, the contract is finished. Make a new contract.

5) Be prepared to walk away from any project that is costing you.

While the video is targeted to web designers, it is helpful to any contractor providing professional services to clients. The tone and focus of the talk is what makes it worth watching. It puts the spotlight on YOU the freelancer and your talent, which is a reminder that you must protect your interests at all times.

Warning: Frank, adult language that may not be suitable for all audiences.
