My partner remarked that writing is a craft or a technique. And that I am a technician. His statement resonated with me. Yes, writing is a specialized skill. Writers cajole words to great heights. We ask these words to become legion as paragraphs, and then web sites, chapters, proposals, even the "Great American Novel."

However, I am uneasy to assign myself the title<strong> Writer</strong> even though my last 3-week assignment contained 20,000 words. Real writers are more than technicians, they are artists. And their words are revisited, quoted, even stolen for many generations.

Once a grant writer endures the labor and births a proposal, it is whisked away to be reviewed, criticized, and the only feedback I receive is:
<blockquote><strong><em>Your proposal has been accepted for funding. Please, returnÂ this contractual paperwork in 10 days.</em></strong></blockquote>
<div>
<blockquote><strong><em>There are many worthy causes out there, and yours may be one of them, but your proposal is going in the recycling bin.</em></strong></blockquote>
I have been honored to have foundation officers remark that the proposal was well-written. In my career, that has happened twice. If only I had recorded those phone calls and digitized them, I could play them back as one might for a lover's voicemail.

With federal grants, I can enjoy the feedback in numerical form. The process is very much like school where a number can bring elation or despair. I confess I have become addicted to the numerical system and am tempted to jockey for points.

It is impossible for a grant writer to not have an existential crisis now and again. We spend weeks creating this unbelievable work of thought, planning, and care. And once the profitability of the proposal has been expended, it ceases to have purpose. Sure, proposals are plundered for boilerplate and reminders of past effort, but they mostly are left forgotten.

I cannot say that a grant writer has it harder than other writers. My girlfriend who writes novels endures a cycle that involves flaying her skin, offering her heart to an agent, shaking off the rejection, and sitting down to write again. For me, I can protect my feelings by making excuses or diving into the next project. And the next. And the next.
