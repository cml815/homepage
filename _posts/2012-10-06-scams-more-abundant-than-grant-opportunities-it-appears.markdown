Grant fraud come in many disguises. Usually they ask you pay for a service or wire money from a phony check they send you. They can reach you by mail, email, or telephone and may use language that sounds truthful or official.

Never pay any money apply for or secure a government grant. There are no fees to pay. Ever.

The government will never send you a notice of a grant without an application. Applying for benefits (such as social security) or grants is a lengthy process.

Very rarely, there are fees for private grants. In those rare cases, you may need to pay to be a member of an association to apply for a grant.

Also, scams target writers with fees, who want to be published. For more information on literary and publishing fraud, please go to <a title="writer beware" href="http://www.sfwa.org/for-authors/writer-beware/">Writer Beware</a> for helpful information.

Here is a recent television news story describing a typical grant scam.
