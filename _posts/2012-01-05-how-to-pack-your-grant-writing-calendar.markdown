The key to securing maximum funding is setting priorities and timing your grant writing calendar properly. A writing calendar can be set at least one year in advance, with room to add major federal grant opportunities that arise. Deadlines vary, although they tend to cluster about 6-8 weeks before the end of the government (September 30th), fiscal (July 1st) and calendar (December 31st) years.

While the temptation is to meet every deadline, that is not possible. Even the most productive, full-time writer has limits in the number of proposals he or she can write. However, the more critical issue is what to do during down times that typically occur during the months of December, May, and June.

Here are some ideas to fill your writing calendar that maximizes funding and preserves precious energy.

**Enter renewal grant proposals in your calendar one year in advance**

Renewed funding from a prior funding source has the greatest chance of success. Foundations and government agencies want to fund agencies with a history of success. Renewal grants typically have success rates that greatly exceed the average. The time and effort in these requests are far smaller than new funding opportunities.

**New funding requests deserve room in your calendar**

The maximum time of continued funding is usually 3-5 years; therefore new requests deserve priority in your annual calendar. Asking for funding from new sources is far more time and energy than renewal requests. However, the time invested in new funding can yield substantial benefits for time to come. New requests need to be entered in the grant calendar at least 90 days in advance to ensure proper time and preparation.

**Allow room in your calendar for unexpected funding opportunities**

Federal funding opportunity announcements (FOAs) often appear like bolts from the blue, but usually there is chatter on discussion boards about them. If you become savvy about the cycle of government funding, these federal grants will not startle you from your grantwriting schedule. If you remain about 14 days ahead of schedule with your expected proposals, you will have time to squeeze major federal grants into your work. The goal is to not sacrifice continued funding for high yield, but intensely competitive federal grant opportunities. And the most winnable federal grants tend to dovetail perfectly with your existing grant program.

Inevitably, there are fewer grants to write, but you can capitalize on the slower pace. This is a time to research funders, learn about federal policy initiatives that will lead to future funding, and to take a risk on grant opportunities with a higher chance of rejection. Whenever you stretch you skills and write for long shots, you improve your writing skills and hone your arguments. Once you lose your fear of failure, the bar for success is set much higher. Give yourself permission to be adventurous. Go ahead and swing for the fences. Even the most legendary baseball slugger strikes out a majority of the time.
