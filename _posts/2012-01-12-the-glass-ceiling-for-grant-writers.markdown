title: The Glass Ceiling for Grant Writers

In my early career, I talked myself into grant writing jobs despite my lack of experience. I sweated my first grants and felt like a fraud for most of the time. However, I worked solo as a grant writer. I never had skilled supervision because I was hired to fill a specialty role. My managers who were often Development Directors edited my drafts, but didn't give strategic guidance. Rarely did they point a prospect my way or give me a pep talk on how to writing an amazing logic model.

The funders themselves were my mentors. I learned to not fear the telephone and called practically every funder to vet my idea. The foundations and corporations were my audience and because I wanted to learn, they shared what they could. I have now a storehouse of maybe 75 foundations that I know like a friend. I know their likes, dislikes, their financial challenges and whether they like to refashion themselves or stay steady.

With experience came success. I was amazed at how many grants I won and how my success percentage had soared. I wanted to do more and maybe rise in the ranks of my nonprofit. However, grant writing is at the level of an experienced, but non-managerial level. Without the ability to delegate work, a grant writer must work faster and harder to raise more. There is no ladder for the grant writer. Therefore, grant writers tend to make lateral jumps to gain more salary and varied experience.

Never in my wildest dreams would I think I'd rise to the top of career. And as I surveyed the scene at the apex, I looked up and saw the glass ceiling. Above me are managers, Directors, Vice Presidents, and so forth. And these high status folks regularly asked me to write for them. And I did and I thought I'd be asked to enter their clique. Naturally, such an invite never came. My gut tells me my gender had something to do with it, but I think it had more that I was more useful and valued as a line grant writer.

The paradox is if I wanted to be a manager or Director, I would have to forgo my greatest passion - the writing. My prodigious output of 200,000 words per year would drop and cause a drop in funding. Somebody has got to make the donuts and somebody has to write the grants. I love writing and hate the talky nature of supervising. Â I had it pretty good, right?

Okay, if I can't be a manager, can my job be more flexible? Naively, I thought telecommuting and flex-time would be a good substitute for having a fancy title. However, in human services, staff have to be seen in their offices. Telecommuting isn't popular among Directors I think because it would weaken their ability to supervise. So many writing professions are done remotely, but grant writing in non-profit holds onto the "development office" concept. We need all hands on deck to be a presence, to remind people we still exist. That we matter.

It is not inspiring to tell a top notch fundraiser to maintain maximum effort for no reward for exceptional performance. It is also demoralizing to tell an excellent staff person that nothing in the organization hierarchy will ever change, yet your grant goal will be automatically increased.

And there I was, facing the glass ceiling. It was as palpable to me if I had been touching a cold window pane. And I cried for several days. Leaving my profession has caused me grief, but it also has inspired hope. I have left office work and made room for another excellent grant writer to succeed. And here in the freelance/consulting world, I have a entire new venture to learn. I'm scared to death, but happy I made the choice.
