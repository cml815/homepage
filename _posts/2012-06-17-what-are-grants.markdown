Grants are a method by which funding is distributed from one entity (grant maker or funder) to another (grantee). Grant makers are usually government agencies, corporations, or foundations. U.S. grantees are often state and local government, non-profit organizations, schools or universities, public housing agencies, businesses, and individuals.

Grants are different from contracts in which money is transferred for a specific service, product, or technology delivered. However, grants are not free money. To successfully compete for a grant, the applicant must make a case that their work meets the specifications (or guidelines) in the call for proposals and that they have the capacity to carry out the work. Instances of fraud and waste have made funders demand accountability, which includes regular financial reports, annual audits, and reports on how the funded work is meeting pre-specified guidelines.

The competitive grants process favors those who have a history of prior grant funding. Early career research investigators and emerging non-profits will encounter difficulty in achieving first time funding. This situation is worsened by flat government budgets and losses that foundations and corporations encountered by the recession. Although the economy has improved, funders have instituted new requirements for accountability that are difficult for smaller agencies to accomplish. The increasing use of web technology has made competition fierce. Applicants have it easier to learn about and apply for grant funding; therefore, more people are applying while total funding has not increased.

The good news is that grant funding is an institutionalized process. Grant funders will not survive and meet their missions without worthy applicants applying and winning funding. Funders understand that innovation will not flourish unless new organizations and novel ideas are allowed to be presented. In some ways, the process is more democratic because of blind review processes and having transparent review criteria to guide writing.

Grant writing is the phrase used for the grants application process. While much of the application is text-based, the real work is raising the organization and individual to the point of grant readiness. Paradoxically, to get funding, the activities already have to be in place and showing results. Therefore, the most competitive applicants have secured resources, whether through a seed grant, fellowship, contract, fees, and individual fundraising. Grants are not designed to launch organizations, but rather give them extra funding to succeed.
