Finding grant opportunities through Google, Yahoo, or Bing search engines is not far fetched or amateur. In fact, it's not a bad place to start. Most grant opportunities are open competitions and not secret, "boys club" operations. If you know the language of grant seeking and you know your professional field, you will locate grant opportunities after a few trial runs.

<h4><strong>Relying on internet searches alone is a losing strategy</strong></h4>

The main drawback is that if you find an opportunity by internet search, it is often <strong>too late</strong>. Funding competitions usually expire within 30-90 days. Yet you will find past announcements in Google for years. It's critical that you learn how to be ahead of the game. It's best to learn about a funding opportunity <strong>before</strong> it is released. The amount of grant funding and level of competition may fluctuate, but the process is predictable.

<h4><strong>Use search technologies that the experts use</strong></h4>

Advances in IT have led to the development of fast and tailored funding search databases. The best and most comprehensive ones come at a price, but if you are employed or enrolled at a university or medical institution, you can access them for free. 

<h4><strong>Forecasting is not only for the weather</strong></h4>

If you take your cue from grant winners, then you will plan far ahead. Research on future opportunities may hinder that sense of urgency in an immediate deadline. But writing in crisis will result in imperfect work. If grants were frequently awarded to those who wrote at the last minute, procrastinators would rule the world. Agencies in the federal government, who award grants, release "Grant Forecasts." It's best to read them on at least an annual basis. Another simple form of grant forecasting is examine funders, who have a predictable cycle. Then you will know that at a certain future point, there will be a new funding opportunity.
