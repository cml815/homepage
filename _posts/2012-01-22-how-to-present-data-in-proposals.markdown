It may be easy to locate mountains of statistics and data to give authority to your grant or contract procurement proposal. But it can be exhausting and bewildering to reduce 500 pages of government data tables into a single, well-written paragraph. This article provides a few guidelines that both preserves time and maintains the integrity of data reporting.<

Provide only the data that is required
----------

The RFP itself will ask for required information. Generally, it is better to only present the required information in a cohesive framework that fits perfectly within a required element in the RFP. The danger of adding extraneous data that will not increase scores on review, or worse, may supplant more crucial narrative elements.

Use data cited in RFP as a framework
------------------

In government RFPs, an applicant may be faced with the question of which data to present: federal, State, or local. Â Top down (federal, State, then local) is adequate for most government grants. However, it is best to cite public federal data rather than reproducing that data yourself.

For example, [Healthy People](http://www.healthypeople.gov) is an initiative by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The initiative is gathering data from 190 sources on a range of health promotion and prevention efforts. In many health RFPs, the key objectives and data from Healthy People are directly cited. There is no reason to duplicate effort. Cite federal data and provide complimenting local and agency data to support the need for funding.

Omit contradictory data, if possible
------------------

Often research and data will be contradictory among different sources. In part, this is because there is "apples to oranges" comparisons where data is collected with different populations, methods, and timeframes. Data presentation varies among government agencies making a seamless narrative nearly impossible. Presenting the most authoritative and clearly expressed data is best for your purposes.

Your data adds value to a proposal
----------------

Some RFPs specifically ask the agency or business to provide data about their service area. Your own ongoing data collection efforts are key to your proposal. Many funders want to learn from their constituent agencies and businesses. This is a great opportunity to educate funders about the need from first-hand experience. Compelling data may include: population demographics, numbers served, cost effectiveness of your approach, emerging trends in the population, unmet needs, and much more. Choose the data that supports the central arguments in your proposal.
